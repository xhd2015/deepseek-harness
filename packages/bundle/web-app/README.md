## Summary

Run `dsh --profile web` to open an interactive browser GUI with chat, model and settings management, and session history. It uses the same model access, tools, and safety defaults as other dsh surfaces. Startup prints an authenticated URL and normally opens it in the default browser; SSH sessions and `--no-open` leave the URL for manual opening. You can change the port and allow extra hosts, but cannot bind all network interfaces. Choose this package for interactive browser work; use `dsh-headless` for one-shot command-line tasks.

## Use this package

Start the GUI, open your browser, and start talking to the agent. The flags fine-tune the invocation.

### Starting the Web GUI

```sh
dsh --profile web
dsh --profile web --no-open --port 8080
dsh --profile web --browser brave
dsh --profile web open
dsh --profile web open ~/proj --browser brave
```

After startup you see a `dsh web:` line whose root URL carries a fresh process token. Unless `--no-open` or an SSH session suppresses it, the chosen browser (`--browser brave|chrome|firefox|edge|safari`, or the OS default) opens that URL, receives a signed cookie, and redirects to the clean root page. You know it worked when the page loads and you can chat with the agent. Two failures to expect: if the frontend is not built, startup stops with a build hint (`pnpm run build` in a checkout); if the browser cannot be opened, a credential-free diagnostic prints to stderr while the server keeps running — open the printed startup URL yourself.

`dsh web open [dir]` talks to that already-running GUI: it registers the directory as a Workspace (reusing the existing one for the same path), creates a new Session, and opens it. The directory defaults to the invoking cwd. If no GUI is serving, the command exits nonzero and tells you to start `dsh web`. `--no-open` on this subcommand still creates the Session.

Supply `-p` / `--prompt <text>` or `--prompt-file <file>` to submit an initial prompt; the two sources are mutually exclusive. Prompt files are read as UTF-8 relative to the invoking cwd, not the workspace directory, and text retains its whitespace and newlines. Unreadable files and empty or whitespace-only prompts fail before Session creation. Add `--no-submit` to save the initial text as an editable draft instead of starting a turn; it requires a prompt source and works with `--no-open`. Prompt text never enters the browser URL. Initial prompt or draft failures exit nonzero and identify the created Session. Browser-launch failure instead prints a credential-free `warning:` on stderr and exits successfully, retaining the Session.

**Settings → Models** displays **DeepSeek**, using `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. The default is `deepseek-official` / `deepseek-flash` (DeepSeek-V41-Flash). The [DeepSeek plugin](../../llm/llm-deepseek/README.md#choose-a-protocol) defaults to Messages; set `protocol: chat-completions` in Cordis YAML to select Chat Completions. Web has no protocol selector.

Saved model selections override the composition default. Both protocols share `deepseek-official` and `llm-deepseek` settings, so switching preserves model selections and credential references. Endpoint overrides retain their values; the settings card lets users supply a compatible API address.

### Configuration

Most users never set these; the command-line flags feed the settings below — `--host`, `--port`, and `--trusted-host` come from the invocation, `--no-open` turns the browser handoff off for that invocation, and `--no-auth` skips process-token browser authentication when an outer reverse proxy already authenticates. `--trusted-host-for-settings` is consumed by the Connection row rather than this plugin's config, because the grant it carries is checked in the browser.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `openBrowser` | `true` | Open the default browser after startup; SSH launches suppress it |
| `printUrl` | `true` | Print the `dsh web:` URL line at startup |
| `surfaceContext` | `true` | Give the agent GUI-orientation context and expose `DSH_WEB_URL` to its shell commands |
| `trustedHosts` | `[]` | Extra hosts allowed to reach the GUI from the network |
| `disableAuth` | `false` | Skip process-token and cookie checks (`dsh web --no-auth`); Host/Origin trust remains |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-web-app) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc.

### LAN access and trusted hosts

By default the GUI accepts connections from this machine only. A deployment that binds all network interfaces also allows browsers from the LAN, and the printed URL then includes a LAN address; `--trusted-host` adds extra hosts in either case. Host and Origin checks control reachability, while the token exchange authenticates every Host API method and WebSocket stream. The LAN addresses are sampled once at startup, so a network change later is not picked up — restart the GUI to re-advertise.

### Settings from a trusted host

Settings live in the Host document and hold model credentials, so a page may read and write them only when it is loaded from a loopback authority — or from an authority the deployment explicitly named with `--trusted-host-for-settings`. Every entry must also be a `--trusted-host`, since the fence would otherwise refuse the page that is meant to use the grant; a violation is a usage error at startup.

```sh
dsh web --trusted-host dsh.example.com --trusted-host-for-settings dsh.example.com
```

Without the second flag an `https://` deployment keeps settings process-local: the Models page renders its "settings live on the machine that runs the harness" notice and directs the operator to the loopback GUI or an SSH forward. The named authorities reach the browser as the `__DSH_SETTINGS_TRUST__` boot global, and the page's own authority is matched against them with the same normalization the fence uses — a port-less entry covers the hostname on any port, an entry with a port must match it exactly. Naming a publicly reachable authority therefore grants settings and credential editing to anyone who can load that page and pass the deployment's authentication.

### Running over SSH

When you launch `dsh --profile web` over SSH, the URL line still prints but the browser is not opened for you: the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarding address. Open the forwarded URL on your machine yourself; the printed URL names the remote host's loopback endpoint.

### Per-session agent setup

Each browser session composes its own agent from the shipped presets (the `standard` preset by default), instead of sharing one process-wide tool set. You can change the default preset or add your own presets under `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets`.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The bundle is one patch plus one runtime glue plugin. The storage stack and projection cache come from `dsh-base`; the web overlay's workspace and message-feedback rows consume that shared `storageDomain` service. The patch restates the surface-specific values the base deliberately omits, inserts the web-only host rows and browser roster, then moves the agent plane behind presets. The glue plugin owns dist serving, trust sampling, prompt sections, the bash variable, and the readiness announcements. The `office-to-pdf` row mounts one lazy [Office conversion provider](../../document/office-to-pdf/README.md) for Host consumers, including Desktop compositions using this bundle. The conversion service's Remote methods authorize preview reads, while Document Preview owns the Office viewer and Client cache.

### Patch semantics

A patch replaces the targeted row's whole `config`, so each web row restates every key it owns: the persona prefix and suffix templates, the `DSH_TOOLS_MODE` PTC mode opt-in, and the `session-query-sqlite` values on the base rows, then `insert` adds the web host rows, transport, and browser roster. The per-agent tool rows the base mounts process-wide are disabled here and the preset roster takes over; the reasoning for each host-plane versus preset-plane decision is inline in the patch.

### Readiness

The URL line and browser handoff are readiness signals: supervisors RPC as soon as they observe the line, and a browser requests the page as soon as it opens, so both run only after the Loader tree settles, the required-startup audit passes, and Connection authentication is available — or immediately in a hand-built tree without a Loader. Client combo JavaScript and source maps remain unmaterialized at this point. Optional plugin failures do not suppress readiness; a required startup failure or a tree disposed mid-boot announces nothing.

### LAN trust sampling

`resolveLanTrust` samples the network once at boot: a loopback bind (`127.0.0.1`) derives no LAN addresses, while an all-interfaces bind adds every non-internal IPv4 literal. The derived literals plus the explicit `--trusted-host` authorities form the `/api` browser-trust fence, and the printed LAN URL always matches that fence.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | The `web-app` glue plugin: dist resolution, LAN trust sampling, prompt sections, bash variable, URL line, browser handoff |
| [`src/startup.ts`](src/startup.ts) | The `web-startup` provider: `--host`, `--port`, `--trusted-host`, `--no-open`, `--browser`, `open [dir]`, `--help` |
| [`src/open.ts`](src/open.ts) | `dsh web open` client against the running GUI |
| [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) | The web patch: restated base values, web host rows, browser roster, agent plane behind presets |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; every contribution (frontend-static child plugin, prompt section, bashEnv registration) is registry-disposed with the fiber, and each owning registry's package carries that relation's invariant; the package holds no mutable state of its own to audit. |
| [`tests/web-app.spec.ts`](tests/web-app.spec.ts) | Dist resolution, fallback seat, prompt sections, readiness |
| [`tests/startup.spec.ts`](tests/startup.spec.ts) | Command-line parsing over a real Loader tree |
| [`tests/trusted-hosts.spec.ts`](tests/trusted-hosts.spec.ts) | LAN-trust sampling |
| [`tests/browser-open.spec.ts`](tests/browser-open.spec.ts) | Default-browser handoff after the page is reachable |

### Invariant ownership

No invariant companion is published because every contribution — the frontend-static child plugin, the prompt sections, and the bash variable registration — is registry-disposed with the fiber, and each owning registry package carries that relation's invariant.

## Model Experience

### Harness-source and Web-surface context

#### What the model sees

When `surfaceContext` is true, the `harness:source` section identifies the on-disk Harness implementation without claiming it is the working directory, and the `app:web-surface` global section (first-party order 10100, after reusable instructions) orients the model to the GUI: the canonical local URL, the "this page" referent, the update contract (the reload receiver is always on; no-refresh reloads additionally need the `pnpm run dev:web` watcher), and the instruction not to start replacement servers. `DSH_WEB_URL` additionally appears in the managed bash environment with its description, resolved per invocation from the live server. When it is false, neither section nor the variable is registered.

#### Token effect

One source line and one prompt paragraph per session plus two managed-environment variable lines; constant per process.

#### KV Cache effect

Source and Web sections follow first-party reusable instructions. Different checkout paths or local ports leave that preceding prefix unchanged when tools and configuration match; provider cache reuse is not guaranteed.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits tell you what to expect in unusual setups — a source checkout, SSH sessions, or strict networks. They are current package constraints, not a general browser comparison or a task backlog.

- **The frontend must be built** — a source checkout needs `pnpm run build` first; startup stops with a build hint when the dist is missing, and there is no source-serving fallback.
- **LAN addresses are sampled once at startup** — interface changes after boot are not re-advertised; the printed LAN URL always matches what was sampled.
- **Only the handoff start is observable** — the GUI reports that the browser was asked to open, not that it actually opened; a later browser exit is never reported, and the printed URL is your manual fallback.
- **SSH sessions keep the URL but skip the browser handoff** — the printed URL names the remote host's loopback endpoint; the SSH client or editor must expose and open the local forwarded address.
- **`BROWSER` overrides only come from the environment** — a discovered `.env` cannot set `BROWSER`; only an inherited value can choose the executable for the automatic handoff.
- **Binding all network interfaces is not supported** — `--host 0.0.0.0` is rejected at startup for safety; use the default loopback host.
